LEAVEPRO
Employee Leave Management System

13. Important React Functional Requirements
Use reusable components instead of writing the same UI repeatedly.
Use React Router for all major screens.
Use state/effect hooks for API data and UI state.
Use derived calculations for dashboard counts and leave balance.
Use controlled form inputs or a form library.
Show loading, empty and error states where appropriate.
Use confirmation before destructive/rejection actions when needed.
Keep API/service logic separate from UI components.
Keep mock data structure close to the proposed database structure.
14. Redux – When to Use
Redux Toolkit is optional. It can be used for authenticated user information, leave request data, global filters and shared dashboard state. If the practical is intended to test basic React skills, useState/useEffect, Context where appropriate, and custom hooks are sufficient.

18. Expected Final Demo
The student should demonstrate the complete workflow:
Login as Employee
Open Employee Dashboard and verify leave counts
Open Apply Leave and submit a valid leave request
Verify the new request appears as Pending
Open Leave History and Leave Details
Open Leave Balance and verify balance information
Logout and login as Manager
Open Leave Requests
Search/filter the employee leave request
Open Leave Details
Approve or Reject the request
Return to the request list and verify updated status
Login/open Employee view and verify the resulting dashboard/history/balance state
